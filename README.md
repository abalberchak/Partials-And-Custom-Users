---

This project was a simple web application using one of Angular's primary features including the use of Controllers and Factories to create and render new JSON data. Users can simply add new users along with other specs on the customize page (partial) and can then view the remaining results on the 'User List' view. Foundation-sites was used as an additional framework for formatting.

Important: Because this project utilizes AJAX calls, this project must be opened with a server for proper performance. (Node.js is reccomended)

Technologies Used: Angular.js, Express.js, Node.js, Foundation-Sites, HTML5, CSS3
